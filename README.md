# power
Power is a C library that implements algorithms for fast exponentiation used in cryptographic schemes. Some algorithms do not execute in constant time, so understanding their applicability—such as in RSA signature verification and RSA encryption—is important before choosing, i.e., do not introduce timing attacks ! 

It uses static allocation.
